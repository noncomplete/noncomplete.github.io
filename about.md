I am an aspiring Materials Scientist from Bangladesh. I am learning about machine learning and how it can be used for accelerating materials discovery and characterization. I will try to document my journey with this blog.

I love linux, vim, tiling window managers, terminals, julia, mechanical keyboards and coffee.
